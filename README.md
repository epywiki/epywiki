## Epywiki
---
**Epywiki** is an epidemiological wiki

Currently it only supports *Kenya* as I found it easier to use a geographical location i understood best.

The site uses vanilla **CSS** , **JS** ,**PHP** and **SQLITE** for portability.

Download the files from github and install in htdocs for windows.

The user who sets up first becomes the admin and can add other users as editors.

Editors can add various diseases which are sorted alphabetically , but can only toggle upto the various wards in Kenya.

The user loggin system is quirky and apologies for that as i have not found a lightweight practical solution of implementing it but currently, when an user wants to become an editor they submit their username and email. The admin then approves , then sends them a link which they use to finish setting up their account and establish their password which they can use to login.

The epidemiological data used for the site is : cases, deaths, report data and notes. Notes are added through markdown as i found it to be the best format for the references and useful data.

To make it a complete wiki some features like version control, user account and talks are still needed. 

Most importantly the site needs to support various locations apart from kenya , i found it difficult to set up other countries as i do not understand their administrative divisions and that unlike kenya i could not identify the threshold of ease of development and data accuracy.

Another problem about the location is that because this project is still in its early stages and i wanted a simple structure which many would find easy and easy to contribute.



Apologies for the simplicity and bugs as its in the early stages
